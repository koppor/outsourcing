## Repository organization

* `matching`: main service outsourcing code
* `matching.application`: configuration to launch the application
* `processes`: example processes

## Requirements

Eclipse Juno.

Download [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/junosr2).

## Installation steps

### Overview

1. Fetch libraries
1. Import projects into Eclipse workspace
1. Create new empty workspace
1. Fetch Eclipse BPEL Designer Model
1. Fetch BPEL model utilities

### Fetch libraries

This is currently not required. We checked in the libraries in the version control as [git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/) currently [has problems with web sources](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/__34__fatal:_bad_config_file__34__/).

 * Right click on it
 * Properties
 * "Java Build Path"
 * "Libraries"
 * Click on the faulty entry
 * Edit
 * Select "Workspace default JRE (jre7)"


## Running the application
